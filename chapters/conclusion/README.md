# Conclusion

Thanks for making it to the end of the Little ASP.NET Core Book! If this book was helpful (or not), I'd love to hear your thoughts. Send me your comments via Twitter: https://twitter.com/nbarbettini

## How to learn more

There's a lot more that ASP.NET Core can do that couldn't fit in this short book, including

* Building RESTful APIs and microservices
* Using ASP.NET Core with single-page apps like Angular and React
* Razor Pages
* Bundling and minifying static assets
* WebSockets and SignalR

There are a number of ways you can learn more:

* **The ASP.NET Core documentation.** The official ASP.NET Core documentation at http://docs.asp.net contains a number of in-depth tutorials covering many of these topics. I'd highly recommend it!

* **ASP.NET Core in Action.** This book by Andrew Lock is a comprehensive, deep dive into ASP.NET Core. You can get it from Amazon or a local bookstore.

* **Courses on LinkedIn Learning and Pluralsight.** If you learn best from videos, there are fantastic courses available on Pluralsight and LinkedIn Learning (including some by yours truly). If you don't have an account and need a coupon, send me an email: nate@barbettini.com.

* **Nate's blog.** I also write about ASP.NET Core and more on my blog at https://www.recaffeinate.co.

Happy coding!

## About the author

Hey, I'm Nate! I wrote the Little ASP.NET Core Book in a long, caffeine-fueled weekend because I love the .NET community and wanted to give back in my own little way. I hope it helped you learn something new!
