# Conclusion

Thanks for making it to the end of the Little ASP.NET Core Book! There's a lot more to ASP.NET Core can do that couldn't fit in this short book, including

* building RESTful APIs and microservices
* using ASP.NET Core with single-page apps like Angular and React
* Razor Pages
* bundling and minifying static assets
* WebSockets

I write about many of these topics on my blog: https://www.recaffeinate.co

The official ASP.NET Core documentation also covers these topics, and more: https://docs.asp.net

Happy coding!

## About the author

Hey, I'm Nate! I wrote the Little ASP.NET Core Book in a caffeine-fueled weekend because I love the .NET community and wanted to give back in my own little way. I hope it helped you learn something new!
